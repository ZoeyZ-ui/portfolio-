Proceed to describe how to install / setup one's local environment / get started with the project.


## Usage
This personal website will help recruiters find me much more easily. 

Recruiters sometimes use Google to their advantage and conduct online searches for top-notch talent. Having this website allow them to stumble upon me and my personal professional website. So owning the search results with my unique domain name, together with making a great first impression, will help me secure an interview.


## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Use a dynamic site (Flask, app.py, & routes). 
- Be more creative 

To do:
- Use the Flask application and have the site deployed from a GitHub pipeline 
- Include more details in my bio, original articles, and be more creative about the layout
